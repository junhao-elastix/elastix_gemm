DOCUMENTATION CLEANUP ARCHIVE - October 14, 2025
================================================================================

Archive Date: Tue Oct 14 02:14:22 PDT 2025
Archive Location: /home/dev/Dev/elastix_gemm/gemm/archive_oct14_docs_cleanup/

Purpose: Archive obsolete debugging artifacts, test snapshots, and historical
         planning documents that have been superseded by current documentation
         (CLAUDE.md, README.md, CHANGELOG.md).

Total Files Archived: 17 files (165 KB)

================================================================================
RATIONALE FOR ARCHIVAL
================================================================================

This archive contains documentation from the MS2.0 GEMM engine integration
and debugging phase (Oct 10-14, 2025). All critical information from these
documents has been incorporated into:

1. CHANGELOG.md - Complete historical record of all changes and bug fixes
2. CLAUDE.md - Current project documentation and architecture
3. README.md - User-facing documentation and test results

These archived files served their purpose during development but are no longer
needed for day-to-day project work. They are preserved for historical reference.

  ✓ CHANGELOG.md                   - Complete historical record
  ✓ README.md                      - User-facing documentation
  ✓ REFERENCES.md                  - Technical documentation index
  ✓ GFP_DOT_PRODUCT_ALGORITHM.txt  - Algorithm reference (useful for compute engine)

Active Scripts (3 files):
  ✓ build_and_flash.sh             - Automated build + flash + validate
  ✓ hex_rescan_registers.sh        - Device recovery script
  ✓ hex.tcl                        - FPGA programming script

================================================================================
RECOVERY INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

If you need to reference any archived document:

1. Navigate to archive directory:
   cd /home/dev/Dev/elastix_gemm/gemm/archive_oct14_docs_cleanup/

2. View file:
   cat CRITICAL_BUG_FIX_PAYLOAD3.md

3. Copy back to main directory if needed:
   cp CRITICAL_BUG_FIX_PAYLOAD3.md ../

However, all critical information from these documents has been incorporated
into the current documentation, so recovery should rarely be necessary.

================================================================================
CLEANUP VALIDATION
================================================================================

Cleanup Criteria Applied:
  ✓ Debug artifacts from resolved issues → ARCHIVED
  ✓ Test snapshots superseded by CHANGELOG → ARCHIVED
  ✓ Planning docs for completed work → ARCHIVED
  ✓ Historical status reviews → ARCHIVED
  ✓ Old build logs → ARCHIVED
  ✓ Essential documentation → RETAINED
  ✓ Active scripts → RETAINED
  ✓ Technical references → RETAINED

Result: Clean project root with only essential documentation and active scripts.

================================================================================
IMPACT ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Documentation Organization:
  BEFORE: 25 documentation files (scattered debugging notes)
  AFTER:  8 essential files (clean, focused documentation)
  REDUCTION: 68% file count reduction

Disk Space:
  Files archived: 165 KB
  Impact: Minimal (logs were largest at 142 KB total)

Project Clarity:
  ✓ Clear separation of essential vs historical documentation
  ✓ Single source of truth (CLAUDE.md, README.md, CHANGELOG.md)
  ✓ Easier navigation for new developers
  ✓ Professional project organization
