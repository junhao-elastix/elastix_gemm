If the true result is equally close to two values, it is rounded to the even one (the one that has LSB = 0).</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If the absolute value of a result is too large to be represented, the result is changed to infinity. Similarly, if the absolute value of a result is too small to be represented, it is changed to 0. The latter case is called underflow, describing the situation where the floating-point result is 0.0 but mathematically the result should not be 0 (for example, subtracting two not quite equal numbers might result in underflow if the numbers are small).</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Internally, all operations are performed with fp24, including the rounding of multiplications and additions. If a 16- bit output format is selected, the fp24 result is then rounded a second time to 16 bits. In rare cases, this double rounding can give a slightly different result than if the operation had been performed with only 16 bits.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part128.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Speedster7t_Component_Library_User_Guide_UG086-1.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part130.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
