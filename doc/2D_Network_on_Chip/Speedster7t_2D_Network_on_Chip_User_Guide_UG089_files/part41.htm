These transfers behave like pushing or popping data to or from a FIFO. The transactions use a &quot;ready&quot; signal to indicate that the logic or the NAP can accept data and a &quot;valid&quot; signal to indicate when data is being transmitted. There are also <span class="s19">tx_dest[3:0] </span>and <span class="s19">rx_src[3:0] </span>signals that indicate the transfer destination and source, respectively. The location ID is a static number along the row or column. For example, on a row, the NAP number starts at 1 with the westernmost NAP and increments to 10 with the easternmost NAP. Similarly, on a column the NAP number starts at 1 with the southernmost NAP and increments to 8 with the northernmost NAP.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Data streaming provides a simple method to push data across a single row or column without using FPGA routing resources. Each NAP endpoint can both send and receive data, although each individual transfer is one way. The receiving NAP does not send an acknowledgement of receiving the data. Additionally, any number of NAPs on the same row or column can send data streaming transactions between each other; however, transactions are only point to point. There is no broadcast option built into the 2D NoC. If it is necessary to broadcast data down a row or column, the design must take this into account and send the transaction along to the next NAP.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The following figure shows transactions between various points in the 2D NoC. The logic at points 1 and 2 have each instantiated a horizontal NAP. The NAPs can both send and receive data, as indicated by the arrows in the figure, but each individual data stream transaction is unidirectional. For example, the NAP at location 1 can send a data stream transaction to the NAP at location 2, and the NAP at location 2 can send a separate data stream transaction to the NAP at location 1. Similarly, the logic at points 3 and 4 both instantiate a vertical NAP and can send data streams between each other.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="571" height="495" alt="image" src="Image_058.png"/></span></p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Figure 19: <span class="h4">Data Streaming</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Any clock domain crossing logic is automatically handled in the 2D NoC. The 2D NoC also handles transaction arbitration internally and can interleave the data streaming with AXI transactions. Keep in mind the full design when using multiple NAPs on a row or column such that traffic congestion is considered. Since data streaming requires a single column or row for the NAPs communicating with each other, it is necessary to be aware of traffic to AXI NAPs on the same row or column. AXI transactions and data streaming can be interleaved and add to latency.</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part40.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Speedster7t_2D_Network_on_Chip_User_Guide_UG089.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part42.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
