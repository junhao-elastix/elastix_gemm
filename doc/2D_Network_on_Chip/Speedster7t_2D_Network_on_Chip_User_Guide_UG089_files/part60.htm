According to the AXI specification, if two transactions are issued with the same transaction ID, the responses must be returned in the same order. If two transactions with the same ID are issued to the same direction (east or west), downstream logic ensures that they are returned in order. But if the transactions are issued in different directions, the responses might be returned out of order. The outstanding transaction table prevents this scenario by allowing transactions to be issued in one direction only if there are no outstanding transactions in the other direction. To accomplish this, a counter is maintained of the number of outstanding transactions for every transaction ID. The counter has a maximum value of 16, meaning that no more than 16 transactions can be outstanding for each transaction ID.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Since this can cause a performance issue, the OTT can be disabled, allowing more transactions to be outstanding at any given time, but also allowing out-of-order responses for transactions in different directions. If a NAP is only ever sending transactions in one direction, or is using different IDs for each transaction, then there is no risk to disabling the OTT. While this can give greater throughput, this parameter should not be disabled unless the NAP is only sending in a single direction, or is using unique IDs, by design.</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="nav">&nbsp;</p><p class="nav"><a href="part59.htm">&lt; Previous</a><span> | </span><a href="../Speedster7t_2D_Network_on_Chip_User_Guide_UG089.html">Contents</a><span> | </span><a href="part61.htm">Next &gt;</a></p><p class="nav">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
