description: Clean up the directory and archive the source files and documents
---

We will clean up the #1 directory.
- Create directorary ./archive_<date> in #1 directory.
- If there is a filelist (#2), archive the source files that are not in the filelist.
- If there is a Makefile (#3), check the targets. archive the source files that are not in the targets.
- Carefully go through the source code. Examine the comments and annotations. Make sure the code is accurate and concise.
- Carefully read the documentation (*.md, *.txt, *.log, etc.) and make sure the information is accurate and concise. It is better to not mention the information than to mention the information that is not accurate. If the document is stale or outdated, archive the document. If the document is reference manual, check inconsistencies and inaccuracies and report to user.
- If there are executable files generated by the code, archive them. Typically, it should be done by `make clean`. 
- If you are not sure about the accuracy and conciseness of the information, ask the user for confirmation.
- If you are not sure about whether to archive the files or not, ask the user for confirmation.
- If you have questions, ask the user for confirmation.
- If #4 exists, use it to guide the cleanup process.
