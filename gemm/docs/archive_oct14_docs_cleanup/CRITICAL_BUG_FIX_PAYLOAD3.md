# Critical Bug Fix: TILE Command Payload Corruption

**Date**: Mon Oct 13 20:30:00 PDT 2025  
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Complete command failure  
**Status**: FIXED and built

---

## Bug Description

### Root Cause
In `master_control.sv`, the `ST_READ_PAYLOAD3` state was **incorrectly latching word3 data into `payload_word2_reg`** instead of `payload_word3_reg`, causing TILE command payload corruption.

### Code Location
**File**: `/home/dev/Dev/elastix_gemm/gemm/src/rtl/master_control.sv`  
**Lines**: 291-305

### Bug Details

**INCORRECT CODE (before fix)**:
```systemverilog
ST_READ_PAYLOAD3: begin
    // Latch payload word 2 ONLY if we successfully transitioned
    if (state_reg != state_next) begin  // Transitioning to DECODE
        payload_word2_reg <= i_cmd_fifo_rdata;  // ❌ BUG! Overwrites word2!
        payload_count_reg <= 3'd2;
        $display("[MC] @%0t LATCH_PAYLOAD2: cmd[2]=0x%08x", $time, i_cmd_fifo_rdata);
    end
end

ST_DECODE: begin
    // Latch payload word 3 (always, since we only enter DECODE after PAYLOAD3 transition)
    payload_word3_reg <= i_cmd_fifo_rdata;  // ❌ Reading stale FIFO data!
    payload_count_reg <= 3'd3;
    $display("[MC] @%0t LATCH_PAYLOAD3: cmd[3]=0x%08x", $time, i_cmd_fifo_rdata);
```

**CORRECT CODE (after fix)**:
```systemverilog
ST_READ_PAYLOAD3: begin
    // Latch payload word 3 ONLY if we successfully transitioned
    if (state_reg != state_next) begin  // Transitioning to DECODE
        payload_word3_reg <= i_cmd_fifo_rdata;  // ✓ Correct register!
        payload_count_reg <= 3'd3;
        $display("[MC] @%0t LATCH_PAYLOAD3: cmd[3]=0x%08x", $time, i_cmd_fifo_rdata);
    end
end

ST_DECODE: begin
    // All payload words already latched in previous states
    // Display decoded command with all 4 words
    $display("[MC] @%0t DECODE: op=0x%02x, payload=[0x%08x, 0x%08x, 0x%08x]",
             $time, cmd_op_reg, payload_word1_reg, payload_word2_reg, payload_word3_reg);
end
```

## Impact

### Symptoms Observed in Hardware
1. **DMA read hangs** - Software stuck waiting for results
2. **Zero dimensions** - `MC_TILE_DIMS = 0x0` (dim_b=0, dim_c=0, dim_v=0)
3. **No computation** - Compute engine never runs
4. **Empty result FIFO** - No data to read back
5. **Device appears hung** - All subsequent DMA operations blocked

### Affected Commands
- **TILE (0xF2)**: Critical failure - dimensions corrupted
- **All 4-word commands**: Payload parsing broken

### Data Corruption Path
```
Host sends TILE command:
  word0: 0xc09f2 (header: op=0xF2, id=9, len=12)
  word1: 0x20000000 (left_ugd, right_addr, left_addr)
  word2: 0x80100 (dim_v[0], flags, vec_len, right_ugd)
  word3: 0x20210 (dim_b=4, dim_c=4, dim_v[7:1]=16)

Master Control FSM:
  ST_READ_HDR → latches word0 ✓
  ST_READ_PAYLOAD1 → latches word1 ✓
  ST_READ_PAYLOAD2 → latches word2 ✓
  ST_READ_PAYLOAD3 → latches word3 into word2_reg ❌ (BUG!)
  ST_DECODE → latches stale FIFO data into word3_reg ❌

Result:
  payload_word1_reg = 0x20000000 ✓
  payload_word2_reg = 0x20210 ❌ (should be 0x80100)
  payload_word3_reg = 0x??????? ❌ (stale/garbage)

TILE command parsing:
  tile_cmd = {payload_word3_reg[22:0], payload_word2_reg, payload_word1_reg}
  dim_b = garbage → 0
  dim_c = garbage → 0
  dim_v = garbage → 0

Compute engine:
  Receives dim_b=0, dim_c=0, dim_v=0
  Does nothing (zero iterations)
  Result FIFO stays empty
```

## Discovery Process

### Evidence Trail

1. **Test hang at DMA read**:
   ```
   [Step 10] Reading results from BRAM...
   DMA reading 16 results from BRAM...
   (Simple adapter: 1 FP16 per 256-bit line, zero-padded)
   [HUNG]
   ```

2. **Debug registers showed zeros**:
   ```
   MC_TILE_DIMS: 0x0 (dim_b=0, dim_c=0, dim_v=0)  ← SMOKING GUN!
   BCV_DEBUG: 0x0 (all zeros)
   ENGINE_STATUS: 0xbb011 (busy=1, mc_state=b)
   ```

3. **Initial hypothesis: Command length mismatch**:
   - Software sends `len=12`
   - Suspected hardware expected different length
   - **REJECTED**: Hardware reads fixed 4 words regardless of `len` field

4. **Verification of 4-word architecture**:
   ```systemverilog
   // csr_to_fifo_bridge.sv:9
   //  - On i_cmd_submit pulse, push 4 words sequentially to command FIFO

   // master_control.sv:317
   // Removed payload_words_needed logic - all commands are now 4 words (header + 3 payload)
   ```

5. **RTL audit revealed payload latching bug**:
   - `ST_READ_PAYLOAD3` overwrites `payload_word2_reg`
   - `ST_DECODE` tries to latch from stale FIFO
   - Dimensions get corrupted
   - Compute engine never runs

## Testing Plan

### Step 1: Flash New Bitstream
```bash
/home/dev/Dev/hex.sh
source /home/dev/rescan
```

### Step 2: Verify Device Health
```bash
cd /home/dev/Dev/elastix_gemm/gemm/sw_test
./test_registers
```
**Check**: Bitstream ID = 0x10132030

### Step 3: Run Full Test
```bash
./test_ms2_gemm_full
```
**Expected**:
- DMA verification PASS
- FETCH/DISPATCH complete
- MATMUL executes (no hang!)
- Results appear in BRAM
- DMA read completes
- Results match golden reference

## Lesson Learned

### Why This Bug Was Insidious

1. **Copy-paste error**: `ST_READ_PAYLOAD2` code was duplicated to `ST_READ_PAYLOAD3`
2. **Subtle symptom**: Didn't crash, just corrupted data
3. **Delayed failure**: Bug manifested as "no results" not "wrong results"
4. **Hidden by FSM**: State machine appeared to work (no hangs in MC)
5. **Wrong initial hypothesis**: Focused on command length, not payload latching

### Prevention

- ✅ Use unique variable names in each state
- ✅ Add assertions to verify payload_count increments correctly
- ✅ Test with debug prints showing all latched words
- ✅ Compare RTL behavior with working simulation
