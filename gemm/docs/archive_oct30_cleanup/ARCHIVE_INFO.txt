Archive Location: docs/archive_oct30_cleanup/
Archived By: AI Assistant (Cleanup Task)

PURPOSE:
--------
Archived completed milestone documents and implementation summaries that
have been superseded by production code and updated documentation.

FILES ARCHIVED (4 files):
--------------------------

1. FLATTENED_BCV_SUMMARY.md
   - Date: October 2025
   - Content: BCV controller flattening analysis and implementation summary
   - Status: Implementation complete, documented in CHANGELOG.md
   - Size: Historical milestone documentation

2. FLATTENED_SUCCESS_COMPLETE.md
   - Date: October 2025
   - Content: Completion report for BCV flattening optimization
   - Status: Success milestone achieved, code now in production

3. PINGPONG_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
   - Date: October 2025
   - Content: Ping-pong buffer implementation details and analysis
   - Status: Implementation complete, documented in CHANGELOG.md and code comments
   - Size: Historical implementation documentation

4. PINGPONG_SUCCESS_FINAL.md
   - Date: October 2025
   - Content: Final success report for ping-pong buffer integration
   - Status: Feature complete and validated in production
   - Size: Historical milestone documentation

REASON FOR ARCHIVAL:
--------------------
These documents capture important implementation milestones but are no longer
needed in the root directory because:

1. Implementation details are now documented in CHANGELOG.md
2. Technical specifications are preserved in:
   - SINGLE_ROW_REFERENCE.md (architecture)
   - STATE_TRANSITIONS_REFERENCE.md (FSM behavior)
   - Source code comments (implementation)
3. Test results are documented in CHANGELOG.md
4. Root directory should contain only active/essential documentation

INFORMATION PRESERVATION:
-------------------------
All critical information from these documents has been incorporated into:
- CHANGELOG.md (implementation history)
- Source code comments (technical details)
- README.md (current status)
- CLAUDE.md (architecture overview)

RECOVERY INSTRUCTIONS:
----------------------
If any archived document is needed for reference:

cd /home/workstation/elastix_gemm/gemm/docs/archive_oct30_cleanup
# Files are preserved here for historical reference

RELATED CLEANUP:
----------------
Simulation profiling documents also archived to:
sim/vector_system_test/archive_oct30_profiling/
