Archived Files Summary
================================================================================
Total: 7 markdown files (~54KB)
- Experimental feature documentation: 5 files (Ping-Pong BCV)
- Historical development notes: 2 files (BCV refactoring)

Experimental Feature Documentation (Ping-Pong BCV)
================================================================================

Context: The dual-FSM ping-pong BCV controller was implemented and achieved 45%
performance improvement in standalone testing. However, integration with the full
compute engine revealed timing issues. The project decided to keep the single-FSM
optimized version (gfp8_bcv_controller_opt.sv) for production reliability.

Status: Experimental work NOT in production, archived for historical reference

1. PINGPONG_INTEGRATION_STATUS.md (5KB, Oct 30)
   - Content: Integration status and timing issues found
   - Key Finding: Standalone test passed (45% improvement), integration failed
   - Decision: Keep single-FSM for production reliability
   - Why Archived: Documents experimental work that didn't make production

2. PINGPONG_V2_SUCCESS.md (8KB, Oct 30)
   - Content: Standalone test results showing 45% improvement
   - Tests: V=4 (30-47%), V=128 (45%)
   - Formula: Achieved 6 cycles/V vs 10 cycles/V single-FSM
   - Why Archived: Documents successful experiment, not current production

3. bcv_pingpong_v2_design.md (9KB, Oct 30)
   - Content: Dual-FSM ping-pong design specification
   - Details: State sharing, handshake protocol, backpressure
   - Why Archived: Design doc for experimental implementation

4. bcv_pingpong.md (6KB, Oct 29)
   - Content: Earlier ping-pong design notes
   - Why Archived: Superseded by v2 design

5. bcv_dual_fsm_progress.md (3KB, Oct 29)
   - Content: Implementation progress notes "IN PROGRESS (60% complete)"
   - Why Archived: Incomplete development notes

================================================================================
Historical Development Notes (BCV Refactoring)
================================================================================

Context: Before attempting ping-pong, the single-FSM BCV controller was optimized
from 9 cycles to 5 cycles for BRAM fill by fixing BRAM latency assumptions.

Status: Completed work, current production uses optimized version

6. bcv_refactor_status.md (4KB, Oct 29)
   - Content: Refactoring status showing 5-cycle fill optimization
   - Achievement: 44% faster fill (9→5 cycles), 23% faster per-V (13→10 cycles)
   - Why Archived: Historical development notes, optimization now in production

7. bcv_refactor_analysis.md (2KB, Oct 29)
   - Content: Root cause analysis for BRAM latency
   - Key Finding: BRAM read is 1-cycle, not 2-cycle
   - Why Archived: Historical development notes

================================================================================
Current Production Documentation (Remaining in docs/)
================================================================================

1. HOST_DMA_RESULT_READ.md (13KB, Oct 31)
   - Content: Current circular buffer result read protocol
   - Status: ✅ PRODUCTION - Documents current architecture

2. MODEL_CONVERTER_INTEGRATION.md (15KB, Nov 2)
   - Content: Integration with ElastiCore model_converter project
   - Status: ✅ PRODUCTION - Documents current integration

3. NAP_Architecture_Analysis.md (4KB, Oct 21)
   - Content: NAP initiator vs responder architecture for GDDR6
   - Key Lesson: User logic needs NAP initiator to read from GDDR6
   - Status: ✅ EDUCATIONAL REFERENCE - Kept for future GDDR6 development
   - Note: References archived G2B processor, but principles remain valid

================================================================================
Production Implementation Status
================================================================================

Current BCV Controller: gfp8_bcv_controller_opt.sv
- Architecture: Single-FSM with 5-cycle fill optimization
- Performance: 10 cycles per V iteration
- Status: ✅ Production, tested and validated
- Trade-off: Chose reliability over 45% speedup from experimental ping-pong

Archived Experimental: gfp8_bcv_controller_pingpong_v2.sv
- Architecture: Dual-FSM with ping-pong buffering
- Performance: 6 cycles per V iteration (45% faster)
- Status: ⚠️ Standalone success, integration timing issues
- Location: src/rtl/archive_nov02/ (archived with other experimental variants)

================================================================================
Key Decisions Documented
================================================================================

1. Ping-Pong Decision (Oct 30, 2025):
   - Standalone testing: ✅ 45% improvement proven
   - Integration testing: ❌ Timing issues with loop indices
   - Decision: Keep single-FSM for production reliability
   - Rationale: Simplicity and proven stability over performance

2. NAP Architecture Learning (Oct 6, 2025):
   - Problem: G2B processor couldn't read from GDDR6
   - Solution: Use NAP initiator, not NAP responder
   - Outcome: G2B processor eventually archived, lesson documented

Future Reference
================================================================================

If considering ping-pong architecture in the future:
1. Review PINGPONG_V2_SUCCESS.md for performance benefits (45% proven)
2. Review PINGPONG_INTEGRATION_STATUS.md for timing issues encountered
3. Consider: Is the 45% speedup worth the integration complexity?
4. Standalone BCV test available: sim/gfp8_bcv_controller/Makefile.pingpong

Educational NAP reference (kept in docs/):
- NAP_Architecture_Analysis.md explains initiator vs responder
- Critical for any new GDDR6 access modules
- Status: Moved back to production docs for easy reference
