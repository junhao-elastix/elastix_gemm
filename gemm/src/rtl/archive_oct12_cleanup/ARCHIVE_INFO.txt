Reason: Cleanup after MS2.0 modular migration and simulation validation

Files archived in this cleanup:
================================

1. vector_top_ms2.sv
   - Status: OBSOLETE - Replaced by engine_wrapper.sv + engine_top.sv
   - Reason: Old MS2.0 integration module, superseded by dual architecture
   - Date created: Thu Oct 2 00:14:43 AM PDT 2025
   - Replacement: engine_wrapper.sv (hardware/CSR), engine_top.sv (sim/FIFO)

2. dispatcher_bram.sv  
   - Status: OBSOLETE - Single-read BRAM, replaced by dual-read version
   - Reason: Not instantiated anywhere, dispatcher_bram.sv is used
   - Date created: Thu Oct 2 00:23:05 AM PDT 2025
   - Replacement: dispatcher_bram.sv (parallel left/right reads)

3. ila_cmd_debug.sv
   - Status: DEBUG ONLY - Not in build
   - Reason: ChipScope ILA debug module, not in filelist.tcl
   - Note: Can be restored if hardware debugging needed

4. dma_bram_bridge.sv.backup_20251010_193214
   - Status: BACKUP FILE
   - Reason: Backup from Oct 10 cleanup (legacy +42 processing removed)

5. elastix_gemm_top.sv.backup_20251010_191533
   - Status: BACKUP FILE
   - Reason: Backup from Oct 10 integration changes

Note on engine_top.sv:
======================
This file is KEPT (not archived) as it serves an active purpose:
- Used in simulation testbenches with direct FIFO interface
- Not in hardware build (engine_wrapper.sv used instead)
- Critical for tb_engine_top.sv validation
- Should remain in src/rtl for simulation accessibility

Validation Status at Archive Time:
===================================
- All 8 test configurations passing in simulation
- Hardware build uses only active files from filelist.tcl
- No broken references after archival

Next Actions:
=============
- Update filelist.tcl to remove archived files
- Verify clean build after archival

6. engine_wrapper.sv
   - Status: ARCHIVED - Replaced by validated architecture
   - Reason: Complex CSR queue replaced by engine_top.sv + simple bridges
   - Date: Oct 12, 2025 19:03 PDT
   - Replacement: csr_to_fifo_bridge.sv + engine_top.sv + result_fifo_to_bram.sv
   - Validation: Build successful, all timing met, bitstream generated

Integration Complete: Sun Oct 12 19:03 PDT 2025
Build Status: SUCCESS (311 seconds, 0 errors, all timing met)
Bitstream: elastix_gemm_top.VP815.1.1.hex (75MB)
