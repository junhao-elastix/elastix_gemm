optimization work and other completed development efforts. These files
are no longer needed for active development but preserved for reference.

IMPACT:
-------
- No impact on current build or functionality
- All production RTL remains in src/rtl/
- Archive contains only failed/superseded implementations
- Previous archives (archive/, archive_oct12_cleanup/, archive_oct14_cleanup/)
  remain untouched and contain their own archived files

RESTORATION:
------------
If any of these files are needed for reference:
1. Files are preserved with original names in this directory
2. Git history contains full development history
3. Consult CHANGELOG.md for context on what replaced each file
