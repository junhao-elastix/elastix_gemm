# An Example of Multi-Tile Dispatch

## The VECTOR_DISPATCH Command
**Note:** See [SINGLE_ROW_REFERENCE](/home/dev/Dev/elastix_gemm/gemm/SINGLE_ROW_REFERENCE.md) for details:

### Command 0xF1: VECTOR_DISPATCH

**Purpose**: Copy aligned data from shared L2 (dispatcher_bram) to private L1 (tile_bram) for each compute tile.

#### Hardware Packing (4-Word Format)

```verilog
// From gemm_pkg.sv and tb_engine_top.sv
typedef struct packed {
    logic [7:0]     man_nv_cnt;     // 8 bits
    logic [7:0]     ugd_vec_size;   // 8 bits
    logic [15:0]    tile_addr;      // 16 bits
    logic           man_4b;         // 1 bit: 0 = 8-bit mantissas, 1 = 4-bit mantissas
    logic           broadcast;      // 1 bit: 0 = distribute, 1 = broadcast
    logic           disp_right;      // 1 bit: 0 = left, 1 = right
    logic [4:0]     col_start;      // 5 bits: starting column for distribution
    logic [23:0]    col_en;         // 23 bits: column enable bitmask
} cmd_disp_s;

// 4-Word Packing:
cmd[0] = {16'd16, cmd_id[7:0], e_cmd_op_disp};          // Header (16 bytes total)
cmd[1] = {8'b0, man_nv_cnt, 8'b0, ugd_vec_size};
cmd[2] = {16'b0, tile_addr};
cmd[3] = {col_en[23:0], col_start, disp_right, broadcast, man_4b};     // flags
```

#### Field Details

- **Mantissa NV count (man_nv_cnt)**
  - Mapped to `man_nv_cnt*4` lines in hardware
  - Number of Native Vectors to dispatch from dispatcher bram in total
  - Each tile will not get all the lines at once
  - Hardware stores as line count: `len = man_nv_cnt*4`
  - Example: 128 NVs â†’ 512 lines

- **UGD vector size (ugd_vec_size)**:
  - Determines how many NV to dispatch to a tile at a time
  - Example: if `ugd_vec_size = 4`, then dispatcher will forward `ugd_vec_size*4` lines to one tile, then the next tile will get the next `ugd_vec_size*4`, until all data has been dispatched.

- **Tile destination address (tile_addr)**:
  - Starting line in tile_bram where data will be written
  - Range: 0-511 (tile_bram has 512 lines)
  - **Alignment**: Handled by software. For hardware simplicity, recommend NV-aligned (multiple of 4)
  - Multiple DISPATCH commands can fill different regions

- **Column enable (24 bits)**:
  - Bitmask for enabling tiles: bit 0 = tile 0, bit 1 = tile 1, etc.

- **Flags**:
  - `man_4b` signals whether the mantissa is in 4-bit format
  - `broadcast`  if asserted, broadcast the same chunk of data to all tiles; if not, distribute data to each tile. 
  - `disp_right` if asserted, dispatch to right brams; if not, dispatch to left
  - `col_start` specifies which column tile the dispatcher should start to forward the data to

#### Operation Modes

See "Broadcast vs Distribute Modes" section above for detailed behavior:
- **Broadcast Mode**: Replicates same data to all enabled tiles (for left activations)
- **Distribute Mode**: Round-robin distribution across tiles (for right weights)

## Example Walkthrough

We walk through an example to see how dispatch is done. Assume we have 4 tiles. B = 2, C = 16, V = 4. Collecting B * C = 32 results in total.

### DISPATCH LEFT

```verilog
logic [7:0]     cmd_id          = 3;        \\ Keep track of the commands
logic [15:0]    tile_addr       = 0;        \\ Dispatch to address 0 in tile_bram
logic [7:0]     man_nv_cnt      = 8;        \\ Need to dispatch 8 Native Vectors in total (B * V)
logic [7:0]     ugd_vec_size    = 4;        \\ Inner dimension has 4 NVs (V, vec_len)
logic           disp_right      = 0;        \\ Dispatch to left
logic           broadcast       = 1;        \\ Broadcast
logic           man_4b          = 0;        \\ Mantissa has 8-bit, default, current hardware does not support 4-bit mantissa yet
logic           col_start       = 0;        \\ Starting from column 0 (tile 0)
logic           col_en          = 0x000F;   \\ Enable four tiles
```

Here's what actually happens:

0. FETCH already puts the data from GDDR6 to dispatcher_bram; dispatcher_bram has data needed for this VECTOR_DISPATCH
1. DC understands there are 4 tiles, all of which are enabled. 
2. DC broadcasts data sequentially from dispatcher_bram_left to tile_bram_left
    1. tile_0_bram [15:0]   <= dispatcher_bram [15:0]
    2. tile_1_bram [15:0]   <= dispatcher_bram [15:0]
    3. tile_2_bram [15:0]   <= dispatcher_bram [15:0]
    4. tile_4_bram [15:0]   <= dispatcher_bram [15:0]
    5. tile_0_bram [31:16]  <= dispatcher_bram [31:16]
    6. tile_1_bram [31:16]  <= dispatcher_bram [31:16]
    7. tile_2_bram [31:16]  <= dispatcher_bram [31:16]
    8. tile_4_bram [31:16]  <= dispatcher_bram [31:16]
3. Dispatch done

### DISPATCH RIGHT

```verilog
logic [7:0]     cmd_id          = 3;        \\ Keep track of the commands
logic [15:0]    tile_addr       = 0;        \\ Dispatch to address 0 in tile_bram
logic [7:0]     man_nv_cnt      = 16;       \\ Need to dispatch 16 Native Vectors in total (C * V)
logic [7:0]     ugd_vec_size    = 4;        \\ Inner dimension has 4 NVs (V, vec_len)
logic           disp_right      = 1;        \\ Dispatch to right
logic           broadcast       = 0;        \\ Distribute
logic           man_4b          = 0;        \\ Mantissa has 8-bit, default, current hardware does not support 4-bit mantissa yet
logic           col_start       = 0;        \\ Starting from column 0 (tile 0)
logic           col_en          = 0x000F;   \\ Enable four tiles
```

Here's what actually happens:

0. FETCH already puts the data from GDDR6 to dispatcher_bram; dispatcher_bram has data needed for this VECTOR_DISPATCH
1. DC understands there are 4 tiles, all of which are enabled. 
2. DC broadcasts data sequentially from dispatcher_bram_right to tile_bram_right
    1. tile_0_bram [15:0]   <= dispatcher_bram [15:0]
    2. tile_1_bram [15:0]   <= dispatcher_bram [31:16]
    3. tile_2_bram [15:0]   <= dispatcher_bram [47:32]
    4. tile_4_bram [15:0]   <= dispatcher_bram [63:48]
3. Dispatch done


### python-style pseudocode:

```python

def dispatch(
        int cmd_id,
        int tile_addr,
        int man_nv_cnt,
        int ugd_vec_size,
        bool disp_right, 
        bool broadcast, 
        bool man_4b, 
        int col_start, 
        int col_en,
        int disp_bram, 
        int tile_bram):
    
    num_tiles = pop_count(col_en)
    disp_addr_start = 0;
    outer_dim = man_nv_cnt/ugd_vec_size # UGD
    inner_dim = ugd_vec_size
    for ugd_idx in range(out_dim):
        for t_idx in range(num_tiles):
            for vec_idx in range(inner_dim):
                if broadcast:

                else:
                    # disp_offset = disp_addr_start + vec_idx*4
                    # tile_offset = ugd_idx*inner_dim*4 + vec_idx*4
                    # tile_bram[t_idx][tile_offset:tile_offset+4] = disp_bram[disp_offset:disp_offset+4]


```
