ARCHIVE INFORMATION - October 30, 2025 Profiling Cleanup
================================================================================

Archive Date: October 30, 2025
Archive Location: sim/vector_system_test/archive_oct30_profiling/
Archived By: AI Assistant (Cleanup Task)

PURPOSE:
--------
Archived detailed profiling and analysis documents from fetcher/dispatcher
optimization work. These documents served their purpose during development
but are no longer needed for day-to-day simulation work.

FILES ARCHIVED (13 files):
---------------------------

FETCHER PROFILING & OPTIMIZATION:
1. FETCHER_OPTIMIZATION.md - Initial optimization proposals
2. FETCHER_DEEP_ANALYSIS.md - Cycle-by-cycle latency analysis
3. FETCHER_LATENCY_FINAL_SUMMARY.md - Final optimization results
4. STATE_MACHINE_OVERHEAD_ANALYSIS.md - Ping-pong state analysis
5. PERFECT_MEMORY_ANALYSIS.md - Zero-latency memory model testing

DISPATCHER PROFILING:
6. DISPATCHER_PROFILE.md - Comprehensive dispatcher profiling results

ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS:
7. BRAM_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md - BRAM interface analysis
8. PARALLEL_ARCHITECTURE_FIX.md - Parallel operation fixes
9. DISP_COPY_BUG_ANALYSIS.md - Dispatcher copy bug investigation

OPTIMIZATION STATUS:
10. OPTIMIZATION_STATUS.md - Optimization tracking document
11. LATENCY_ANALYSIS.md - General latency analysis
12. PHASE4_RESULTS.md - Phase 4 testing results
13. CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md - Previous cleanup documentation

REASON FOR ARCHIVAL:
--------------------
These profiling documents were essential during the optimization phase but:

1. Optimization work is complete - profiling code commented out in RTL
2. Key findings documented in CHANGELOG.md (Oct 30 entry)
3. Final code is clean and production-ready
4. Detailed cycle-by-cycle analysis no longer needed for regular development

WHAT WAS PRESERVED:
-------------------
Essential information retained in production codebase:
- Profiling code preserved (commented) in fetcher.sv and dispatcher.sv
- Optimization results documented in CHANGELOG.md
- Performance characteristics in code comments
- Test results in CHANGELOG validation entries

ACTIVE SIMULATION DOCUMENTATION:
---------------------------------
Files remaining in sim/vector_system_test/:
- README.md - Simulation setup and usage
- SOURCE_FILES.md - File manifest
- Makefile - Build system

RECOVERY INSTRUCTIONS:
----------------------
To reference archived profiling documents:

cd /home/workstation/elastix_gemm/gemm/sim/vector_system_test/archive_oct30_profiling
# All 13 profiling documents preserved here

To re-enable profiling in RTL:
1. Edit src/rtl/fetcher.sv - uncomment profiling sections
2. Edit src/rtl/dispatcher.sv - uncomment profiling sections  
3. Rebuild simulation
4. Refer to archived documents for analysis methodology
